today the second day on this newly created age a strange thing happened. it was not strange to me but the three boys did not understand what was happening. while i was relaxing under a large tree on one of the smaller rock islands, it began to rain. it was a nice rain that lasted for about an hour in the morning. i explained to the boys that the rain was not harmful, yet they obviously still feared it. before going to sleep tonight i told the boys i would leave the following day. i told them that while i was gone, i would make a surprising change in their world. they didn't understand (not that i expected them to.)
