the lighthouse is finished and we are all proud of our creation. the boys are amazed at the structure wrought from rock with their own hands. that evening we powered up the generator - much to the boys' dread at first, and shined a great light to the horizon for many hours. i stayed the night in the top of the lighthouse and in the morning awoke to observe the sunrise without my being coated with the chilly blanket of ocean dew i had become accustomed to.
