the nights are absolutely beautiful here. i have made note of and named a number of constellations that pass above me. also during the night, i catch glimmers of light from the horizon which i have not been able to discover if it is created by some natural phenomenon or by additional people on far off islands or rocks. i should very much like to discover which. (i rather suspect it is additional people, which would explain the appearance of branch and will.)
