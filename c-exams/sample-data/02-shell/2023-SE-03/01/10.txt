it has been 10 years since i left this age, which i have since called the stoneship age. upon returning i can not believe the changes that have taken place. the original 3 "boys" have grown unto adults, and there are many new faces that i do not recognize. branch told me that it has not rained for seven years and the cool breezes are back again.

they are all very content and have been serving me with new foods and showing me new materials they have discovered. it even seems they have found gold somewhere; i see it in many forms around the island.

my lighthouse has been kept in perfect condition and it looks as if they have tried their very best to keep it so. yet i have noted that the entire rock it was built on has sunk approximately 40 or 50 centimeters.

after a wonderful visit with my old friends, i wonder aloud with them what things will be like here in another 10 years.
