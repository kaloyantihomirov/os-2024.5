i still do not fully understand what happened today.

i was experimenting with the art - testing the limits of the rules as dictated to me by father. i attempted to create a boat by writing it into the world. i thought everything was planned correctly, yet somehow the boat had become gripped by the rock and broken in half. although this test did not turn out as i had hoped, i now have answers to a few of the questions my father never answered.

as for the boat, i can see the boys enjoy it anyway and with that i am pleased. they have played on it all day.

even though the boat cannot move i have enjoyed studying from it. it is a much sturdier platform than the jagged rocks.

in the course of my observations i have learned some very interesting things regarding the solar system of this age.
