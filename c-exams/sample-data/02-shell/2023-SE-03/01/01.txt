emmit was the first to live on the rocks. he named them the rocks because that is what they were: a group of sharp rocks clustered together in the middle of a large sea. this was where emmit lived; he enjoyed his life. emmit would occasionally swim to nearby rocks, as it was never too far of a distance.

one day another person appeared on the rocks, for no apparent reason to emmit. emmit named this new person, branch. emmit and branch quickly became friends, swimming and hunting for fish together often. emmit showed branch the simple cave in which he lived on the largest rock. soon, branch discovered a place where he decided to live, also on the same large rock. the sun always shone brightly on their world, and the water was always dazzlingly clear, allowing them to see almost to the deep ocean floor which surrounded them. though the sun always shone, it was never too hot for the boys. a light breeze always came from the north and cooled the area down.

one day while branch was swimming and having fun in the water he noticed another boy swimming. branch brought the new boy to emmit to find out what to call the new boy. emmit said the boy should be called will. will was soon a part of the group, and all three of the boys swam and enjoyed their perfect world.

at least, that is the story i was told when i arrived today on the island. emmit, branch, and will were surprised to see me at first, but even before the night ended we were all becoming good friends.
