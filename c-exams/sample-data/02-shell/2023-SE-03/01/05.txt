the rain today was slightly heavier than usual. just when the boys were getting used to the light rains, a small storm arrived. they were frightened of the heavier rain, not to mention the thunder and lightning. if rain has never fallen here until recently, as the boys tell me, i would like to discover why it is falling now. regardless, i have decided to return home for a short while. i have also been thinking of some plans for a lighthouse that i hope to construct soon. i think that perhaps by shining a bright light toward the horizon, it might prove my suspicions regarding additional inhabitants. they would be curious about the light and travel to discover its source - if they have the means.

i returned with many tools that i will need for construction of the lighthouse. i have decided that once the lighthouse is completed i will leave for some time and let the world's own imagination have control.
