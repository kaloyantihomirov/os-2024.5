it was will who first saw the girl. she was swimming not far from the boat where will was getting ready to hunt for fish. then will noticed a man not far away from the girl. emmit was very pleased to meet the additional neighbors.

i feel pleased to leave this age - i have set in motion events that have nothing to do with writing or the art, that will have a more profound impact on this world than i could have ever written. i think of this age as a gift to myself that i will wrap up and open someday in the future, only to discover that it has changed so much that indeed it is a surprise. besides i have yet another new age that awaits me. it seems i'm going to need some way to travel underwater in this new age, and so much planning is in order.
