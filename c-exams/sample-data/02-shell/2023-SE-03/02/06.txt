i have told my sons that they will be returning with me in two days. they spent the entire night telling me of an adventure they experienced in my absence and it was rather remarkable. it seems they constructed a boat with the creatures and traveled some ways out into the surrounding waters. i enjoy hearing them talk excitedly of their adventures and am reminded of my own adventures as a child.
