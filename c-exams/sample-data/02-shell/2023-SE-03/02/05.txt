i have lived on this world for three months off and on, and the tree-dwellers have shown great hospitality. i am even beginning to learn bits of their language. i have decided to return home for an extended stay with my loving wife and my sons, and, hopefully return with them. however, i am sure catherine will once again refuse. i think this age would be a wonderful experience for them all, and i at least look forward to how sirrus and achenar will react to its curious inhabitants.

catherine is staying behind, as expected. my sons have returned with me and they enjoy this age very much. they get along very well with the tree-dwellers and are picking up their language surprisingly fast. i have no doubt that it will not be too long until they can speak with the tree-dwellers much better than myself.

i am leaving tomorrow to check on osmoian age. sirrus has suggested that i allow him and his brother to stay. though the idea unsettles me, i know the boys are growing up rapidly. the hospitality of these creatures is such that i could think of no better place to leave them for a short while, so i will consent to their request.

i warned the boys not to take advantage of the respect the tree-dwellers have for their ideas. they seemed to understand my warning, and i have faith they will follow it.
