this morning i awoke, finding it hard to even believe the previous evening's events. the water is a dull green for as far as i can see now. for some reason, the water no longer shifts color.

as i wander throughout the pathways, the creatures watch me, curious to see what i will do next. they are constantly offering me strange objects of affection. i even found food outside the doorway to the room in which i had slept. this is a unique race of beings. i hope to learn their language soon so that i may learn more from them.
