i finally understand why the tree-dwellers have been giving me their many inks and insisting i write with them. looking through some of my past entries i see now that the inks have changed from the black, i thought they were, to various different colors. i have shown some of the creatures my journal and they laughed and howled. i did not know they had such a sense of humor. even now as i look through this very "colorful" journal, i cannot help but laugh myself.

we will be returning tomorrow, so my sons are with the creatures for the last night here. they have told me they would like to come to channelwood again, and also asked if they can visit some other ages alone. though i will have to think over their request, i believe that they have proven to me that they are are trustworthy and responsible. catherine will also have to help me decide whether they are ready for travel alone. for now i must give my farewells to the creatures, for i do now know how long it will be until i visit this age again.
