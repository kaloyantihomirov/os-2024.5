i have called this age channelwood and it is a very different world. though it is exactly how i imagined it, it is still amazing to see it with my own eyes. water covers this age as far as i can see except for a small rocky island. elsewhere, there are only trees, which grow directly out of the water. a myriad of thin wooden passageways are built just above the water and disappear into the forest. i assume they were built some time ago for they appear aged. i am eager to discover more about this land and its people, but i have arrived here late and i must rest.
