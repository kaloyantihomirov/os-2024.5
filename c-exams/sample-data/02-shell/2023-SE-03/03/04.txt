last night i was awakened by a horrible hissing. i was sweating, and the heat was so intense that i immediately dipped my head in a nearby stream to cool it down. the hot breezes had returned, along with a low roar from the ground. i walked a short distance to observe some red flames shooting up from the earth. suddenly the ground began to crack and a huge chasm opened. the chasm continued to grow until it was far too wide to cross. then the tumult subsided leaving only a dull roar. i have decided, however, i can use the chasm to my advantage. perhaps the heat from the chasm can be harnessed.
