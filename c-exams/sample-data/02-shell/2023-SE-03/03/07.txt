i am leaving today in order to bring back sirrus and achenar. i have left them alone in channelwood. i believe they will enjoy all there is to see here. the age seems to have stabilized. i believe the meteors set off a period of volcanic activity by piercing into the shallow crust. but the tremors have become few.
