the abundance of raw materials here is beginning to amaze me. i have returned with some of the complex tools i knew i would be needing. i assumed i would have to return for more basic materials, however, it seems as though i will be able to find everything i need here. of course iron is abundant, but i have also found titanium occurring naturally. i am all the more excited to begin work. everything is set and i look forward to tomorrow. my raw materials are all here; i think i will be able to have most of my additions to this age completed within one year. i so love working with my hands - whether writing or building.
