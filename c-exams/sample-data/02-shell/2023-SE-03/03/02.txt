i have had to return home due to an unpredictable natural occurrence more frightening than i have ever experienced. i was awakened by terrible shakings in the ground and explosions on all sides of me. gigantic balls of fire were falling from the sky and i immediately left in fear of my life. i must remember to bring a myst linking book with me when i return, in case the one left there has been destroyed or damaged.
