even as the chasm has ripped into the surface of this world it has opened up a whole new world to explore. although uncomfortably hot, i found it possible to reach a cave in the chasm that had been created. and have now explored deep into the crust of this planet. i have found a vast underground cave system that will take many years to map and explore. i will also look for a safer way to reach the underground than through the chasm wall.

this age seems to change on its own, so i feel i should leave again and see if things are different when i return. it is also important that i check on sirrus and achenar and make sure everything is going along well. when i return, i also hope to bring back some tools i will need for my plans to explore the underground.
