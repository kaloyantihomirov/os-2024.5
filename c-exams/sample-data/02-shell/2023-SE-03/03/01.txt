it has been a while since i have heard only silence and i enjoy it greatly, i think. for some reason, i do not feel altogether welcome in this new world in which i have arrived. but how could i be unwelcome in an age with no inhabitants? it is, of course, only in my head.

this world is very beautiful. (but i think i have yet to ever write in a journal that an age i have linked to is horrid or disgusting.) from the grassy hill where i am standing, i can see green fields below along with a few scattered forests. a rather large lake looms some distance from where i am standing, yet the water's blue can be seen plainly from here. the air is fresh and the sky is sparkled with white clouds. it is absolutely breathtaking, and yet, that strange feeling again. perhaps it is the hot breeze that continues to blow from the north. hotter than i would have imagined, it almost singes my skin, and i feel quite uncomfortable when it comes. i will try to ignore it. night has almost arrived and the sunset is spectacular. oranges and reds have settled above the western horizon.

though night has come, the horizon still glows red long past the sunset. dark reds flow from the horizon and blend into the black sky. again the feeling, and i am beginning to believe it is not all in my mind. i must sleep now, i will need my strength to explore more tomorrow.
