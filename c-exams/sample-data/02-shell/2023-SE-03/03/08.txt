i have just noticed that a large amount of this journal has curiously vanished from the very pages on which i wrote over the last eighteen months. fortunately, i have copied many of my construction notes in another journal. i do not understand the many mysteries of this world but i trust i will discover logical answers to my questions. i have a feeling that many of my questions can be answered in another age to which i hope to travel soon. but for now i must simply accept this world's mysteries and take pride in my accomplishments.
