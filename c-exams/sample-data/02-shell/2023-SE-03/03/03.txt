i have returned to a different world than the one i left only three months ago. it has been transformed into a barren, desert land, with only gigantic craters scattered across the land to provide variety. strangely enough, the small grassy hill where i spent my first night remains exactly the way i found it. apparently the falling meteors did not hit this area, leaving an oasis in the midst of this horrible desolation. the hot wind i remember has turned into a rather pleasant breeze, which is at least one improvement. i fear it is the only improvement.

the magnificent lake i saw on my first visit is now completely dried up. however, another lake now exists and appears to be quite a bit larger. i assume one of the falling meteors created this lake due to its circular shape and the jutting rock that grows out of the center of the lake. the rest of this world seems like desert, although i will verify that statement with closer inspection.

though this world has little visual excitement to offer, it offers much to the ears. sounds constantly flow through my ears and i have found where a few of them originate. it seems (as catherine says) i do find beauty in everything.
