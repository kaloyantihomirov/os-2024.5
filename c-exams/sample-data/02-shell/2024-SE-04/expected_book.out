I've finally made a breakthrough. I have succeeded in modifying the Fire-marbles to generate enough power to hold a
Descriptive Linking Book in a stable matrix: I have linked to a new world! It is a harsh and desolate Age ~ but is
nonetheless well suited for my purposes, and so I have designated it my 233rd. By studying it closely, I believe I will
eventually be able to create a more appropriate Age for us to resettle on. For now, I will build an office and set up my
living quarters there, in order that I may conduct my experiments in safety and without distraction.
I must admit that I am proud of my work - to think, that in such primitive conditions I have accomplished in 29 years
what it took the original D'ni centuries to achieve.
(Note: repair outer wear for work on this world; the goggles may need to be redesigned altogether.)
